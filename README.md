# Zombie Conga 🧟‍♂️

Zombie Conga is a fun and fast-paced 2D game built using Apple’s SpriteKit framework. You play as a zombie who moves across the map collecting cats and avoiding enemy. 

Your goal is to reach the end of the level without losing all your lives. Each cat you pick up you gain points, but enemies will try to stop you. Watch out – if you get hit, you’ll lose a life and have to start again!

## 🎮 Features
- ❤️ **Three Lives**  
  The player starts with 3 lives. Colliding with enemies reduces one life.

- 😼 **Cat Collection = Points**  
  Each time you collect a cat, you gain **+1 point**.

- 🚀 **Dynamic Difficulty**  
  As you progress further, the enemy **ladyCat** becomes faster, increasing the challenge.

- 💥 **Enemy Collision Penalty**  
  Colliding with a **ladyCat** will reduce **both your life and your score**.

- 🎲 **Random Cat Spawning**  
  Cats spawn at random positions and disappear if you don’t collect them in time.

- 📍 **Random Vertical Spawning for Enemies**  
  **ladyCat** always enters from the right side but spawns at a random Y-axis position.

- 🔊 **Sound Effects & Background Music**  
  The game includes sound effects and background music using **AVFoundation**.
